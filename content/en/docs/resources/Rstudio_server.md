### Getting started with Rstudio in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏èüíª
RStudio Server enables you to provide a browser based interface to a version of R running on a remote Linux server.
This allows you to work on complexe datasets/models without the worries of your computers own ressources.

Using Rstudio in the cloud also allows you to save your work in a safe environment without the worries of your laptop battery dying or your hard drive crashing.

Using Rstudio Server combined with git is a powerful way to streamline your work and test compute intensive mehtods before deplying to a High Performance Computing service such as [Compute Canada](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/security/login)
