These grants give you full-time funding to work with a professor to conduct research. 
Deadlines are January/February of each year and eligibility is based almost entirely on GPA. 
The NSERC one pays more but is more competitive.

##### Other Grants

There are a few paid EL opportunities but this specific site is a $2000 grant to work on a hands-on experiential learning project.

 * [Concordia's Student Hub Undergraduate Awards page](https://www.concordia.ca/students/financial-support/scholarships-awards.html)

Concordia's financial aid & awards grant webpage. It might be a little hard to find relevant-to-you information, but this is the master list of undergrad funding opportunities.

#### BIOL 490
This is a year long course that satisfies the thesis requirement for honours students. 
It involves working with a professor to design and carry out an independent research project.
This is a great opportunity to conduct research that interests you while gaining experience and credit.
