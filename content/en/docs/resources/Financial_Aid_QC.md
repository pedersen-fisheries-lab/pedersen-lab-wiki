### Financial Aid (Quebec Students)

Thinking about applying for student loans?

The Quebec government offer a mix of loan and a bursary which can up to match the amount of your stipends allowing you to focus on what is important. 

These are in the form of a mix bursary (major part of the split) and loan.
Loans are interest-free while you study.

Avoid the September rush and fill out your application for student financial assistance now. Applying early significantly reduces processing delays and ensures you get your funding on time to pay for your tuition.
