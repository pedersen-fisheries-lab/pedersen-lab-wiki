Getting started #To get started, kindly email Eric so that an account can be started for you.
Usernames \u0026amp; Passwords are CASE SENSITIVE
Signing in #Head over to : http://10.203.131.88:8888/ and log in with your personal details.
Uploading your scripts #There are 2 ways of getting code and data on the server. For your code I recommend setting up GitHub and pulling your project (see below).
OR
Alternatively, you can zip your scripts and data (within a single zip file) and use the upload function found in the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer section. Then select the directory where you want your files to be transferred to and the files will be uploaded and automatically extracted into the selected directory after clicking the \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; prompt. Using resources #The server has a certain number of cores reserved for Rstudio instances. However, the memory is shared with all the users. Please be careful when running memory-intensive scripts.
Currently, the server has : 10 CPU Cores 64gb of memory
Setting up a user (Admins only) #Log in to the server locally or via SSH Run the following code: #### 1. Get Rstudio Docker ID #### sudo docker ps -a #### 2. Open Container interactive shell #### docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash #### 3. Set new user login id #### my_user=new_user #### 4. Add the user #### useradd \${my_user} #### 5. Set the user password #### passwd \${my_user} #### 6. Create a home directory for the new user #### mkdir /home/\${my_user} chown \${my_user}:\${my_user} /home/\${my_user} #### 7.

You think you need to create a new section? Submit an issue on GitHub beforehand to open the discussion on that topic. Be careful to contribute on a separate branch than main. Open a PR for review to merge your contributions into main. Contributing to an existing page #To contribute to an existing page you have two options:
Recommended: Edit the file directly on Github. On the wiki, you can navigate to the page you wish to edit, scroll to the bottom and click on \u0026ldquo;edit this file on GitHub\u0026rdquo;. This will bring you the location of the file on GitHub and allow you to edit the file directly. If you have a lot of edits to contribute, we recommend your work out your content outside of the GitHub editor (for example you can use a markdown editor like StackEdit). Fork the repository, edit in your fork and submit a pull request to the main repo. To learn more about forks, see the GitHub help on that topic. Creating a subsection (new page) #Creating a new page requires creating a new file. The easiest way to do so is to go on GitHub, navigate to the folder content/en/docs, and select the folder that corresponds to the section you want to add a page into (for example, resources). You can then click the button \u0026ldquo;add file =\u0026gt; create new file\u0026rdquo;.
Each new page requires a special header (see below).
--- title: \u0026quot;New Page Title\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- The title of the page --\u0026gt; draft: false \u0026lt;!-- Whether this is a draft page, leave as false --\u0026gt; images: [] \u0026lt;!-- Leave blank --\u0026gt; menu: docs: parent: \u0026quot;resources\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- Must the name of the folder (section) the page is in --\u0026gt; weight: 100 \u0026lt;!-- The weight in the sidebar (controls placement) --\u0026gt; toc: true \u0026lt;!-- Whether to show the table of contents--\u0026gt; --- Creating a section (new folder and new page) #There are three steps for creating a new section:
Create a folder named for the new section within content/en/docs/. The name of that folder will be used in what follows as folder-name.
Edit the menu file by adding a [[docs]] entry of the type:
[[docs]] name = \u0026quot;Resources\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- The name of the section --\u0026gt; weight = \u0026lt;!-- The weight in the sidebar (controls placement) --\u0026gt; identifier = \u0026quot;folder-name\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- The name of the folder you created --\u0026gt; url = \u0026quot;/docs/folder-name/\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- The path to the folder within content/en/ --\u0026gt; Create an index file. This file must be named _index.md and be placed within the folder your created (folder-name). It must contain the following header but must remain empty of other content: --- title : \u0026quot;Resources\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- The name of the section --\u0026gt; description: \u0026quot;Lab resources\u0026quot; \u0026lt;!-- The description of the section --\u0026gt; draft: false \u0026lt;!-- Whether this is a draft section, leave as false --\u0026gt; images: [] \u0026lt;!-- Leave blank --\u0026gt; weight: 100 \u0026lt;!-- The weight in the sidebar (controls placement) --\u0026gt; --- Once you have created a section, you can refer to the previous paragrapphs to create the first new page of that section.
